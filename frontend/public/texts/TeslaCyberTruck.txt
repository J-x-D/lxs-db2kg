The Tesla Cybertruck is a battery electric full-size pickup truck built by Tesla, since 2023. Introduced as a concept vehicle in November 2019, it has a triangular body design with flat sheet metal panels made of stainless steel. Tesla was initially aiming to bring the vehicle into production in 2021. After a series of delays, production Cybertrucks were first delivered to customers in late November 2023. As of December 2023, the Tesla Cybertruck is available only in North America. Three models are offered: the tri-motor all-wheel drive Cyberbeast, a dual-motor AWD model, and a rear-wheel drive model, with EPA range estimates of 250â€“340 miles, varying by model.
