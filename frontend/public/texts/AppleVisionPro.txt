Apple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset developed by Apple Inc. Announced on June 5, 2023, at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference, pre-orders began on January 19, with deliveries scheduled to begin on February 2, 2024, in the United States. A worldwide launch has not yet been scheduled. It is Apple's first new major product category since the Apple Watch in 2015. Apple markets the Vision Pro as a 'spatial computer where digital media is integrated with the real world, and physical inputs—such as motion gestures, eye tracking, and speech recognition—can be used to interact with the system. Apple does not promote the device as being a virtual reality headset, and has avoided the use of terms such as virtual reality and augmented reality when discussing the product.
