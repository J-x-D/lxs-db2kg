# LXS DB to KG (MonoRepo)

Welcome to the home of the LXS DB to KG application.

We have split the application into three parts:

- [Frontend](./frontend/README.md) - A Next.js application that is built using React and Typescript and Material UI.
- [Backend](./backend/README.md) - A python application that is responsible for converting a db to a knowledge graph.
- [External](./db/README.md) - We have included the database in here and a few examples for ontologies.

## Getting Started - Development
